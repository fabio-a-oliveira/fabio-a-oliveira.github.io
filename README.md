## [Project] [A model for predicting movie ratings](https://fabio-a-oliveira.github.io/2020-09-21%20HX9_MovieLens_Report.html)

A model for predicting movie ratings on the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset. A series of models of increased complexity are proposed considering user and movie average ratings, user preferences for particular movie genres, movie age at the time of rating, and finally the application of Item-Based Collaborative Filtering.

Created as part of the capstone project for the [HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science).    

A very simple web-based recommendation system based on a minimalist version of the model is hosted at [https://fabio-a-oliveira.shinyapps.io/MovieRecommenderApp/](https://fabio-a-oliveira.shinyapps.io/MovieRecommenderApp/).

## [Project] Stock data reduction via identification of “pivot points”

A naive encoding of time series data, created before DNN. A combination of a 1D conv-net for encoding and a recurrent network for inference would be much better suited. Cool visualizations though!

## [Project] Gender bias in research funding

An investigation on the data from a 2015 PNAS research paper (used as a pretext for practicing R-Markdown).
