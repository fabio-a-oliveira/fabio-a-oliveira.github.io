## [Generating aviation regulations with RNNs](https://fabio-a-oliveira.github.io/2021-04-01_14-CFR-FAA.html)

Over the last decade, I spent of lot of time ensuring that aircraft, operations and airmen comply with civil aviation regulations from around the globe. I thought this topic would be an interesting pick for exploring the application of Recurrent Neural Networks to the creation of original text.   

In <a href="https://fabio-a-oliveira.github.io/2021-04-01_14-CFR-FAA.html">this article</a>, I explain how I trained a stack of Gated Recurrent Units on the full corpus of FAA regulations and discuss the results of using the model to generate new text following the same style. You can also see a teaser in the block below or visit [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabio-a-oliveira/14-CFR-FAA/main/generated_text/generated_text___1000000_chars__2021-03-27__21-15-26.txt) for a 1-million characters sample of original regulatory text.

## [Generating original music in the style of Bach's four-part chorales](https://fabio-a-oliveira.github.io/2021-03-10_Bach_chorales.html)

I'm sure by now everyone has seen examples of AI applications where an algorithm is left to train for some time on a large corpus of text or music and can then be used to create new content following the same style. This project is my take on training a recurrent neural network on the full set of JS Bach's four-part chorale pieces and then using it to create some new, original music.   

<a href="https://fabio-a-oliveira.github.io/2021-03-10_Bach_chorales.html">This article</a> gives a high-level description of the project and showcases some examples generated by the trained network. If you want to skip the details and just listen to some music, these are two of my favorite pieces:

## [Mechanisms-of-Action prediction](https://fabio-a-oliveira.github.io/2020-11-26%20HX9_CYO_Report.html)

A statistical model for predicting the Mechanism of Action of a drug based on gene expression and cell viability data.

A _**mechanism of action (MoA)**_ is a label attributed to an agent to describe its biological activity.  By being able to properly identify a molecule’s MoA, it can subsequently be used in a targeted manner to obtain a desired cell response.

The final model is a weighted average of predictions from several individual models: Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes with loess smoothing, Support Vector Machine and Multi-class Penalized Mixture Discriminant Analysis.   

Created as part of the capstone project for the [HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) and inspired by a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa).

## [A model for predicting movie ratings](https://fabio-a-oliveira.github.io/2020-09-21%20HX9_MovieLens_Report.html)

A model for predicting movie ratings on the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset. A series of models of increased complexity are proposed considering user and movie average ratings, user preferences for particular movie genres, movie age at the time of rating, and finally the application of Item-Based Collaborative Filtering.

Created as part of the capstone project for the [HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science).    

A very simple web-based recommendation system based on a minimalist version of the model is hosted at [https://fabio-a-oliveira.shinyapps.io/MovieRecommenderApp/](https://fabio-a-oliveira.shinyapps.io/MovieRecommenderApp/). You can also use it in the frame below:

## [Stock data reduction via identification of “pivot points”](https://fabio-a-oliveira.github.io/2020-08-04_stock_data_simplification.html)

A naive encoding of time series data, created before I knew anything about recurrent neural networks. A combination of a 1D conv-net for encoding and a recurrent network for inference would have been much better suited to the task. Cool visualizations though!
