### [Project] Mechanisms-of-Action prediction

A series of models for predicting the mechanism of action for different drugs based on gene expression and cell viability data. Created as part of the capstone project for the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate and inspired by a Kaggle competition.

### [Project] A model for predicting movie ratings

A model (or rather series of models) for predicting movie ratings based on the MovieLens dataset. Created as part of the capstone project for the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate.

### [Project] Gender bias in research funding

An investigation on the data from a 2015 PNAS research paper (used as a pretext for practicing R-Markdown).
